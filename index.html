            <p>Hi everyone! I'm Brandy. I currently work at Chick-fil-A Appleton as the Talent Coordinator. Throughout my time at FVTC, 
            I've noticed that I best learn in person but I'm still actively taking half of my courses online.
            I'm the youngest in my family which allows me to hand my nieces back to my siblings whenever they 
            get too difficult for me. </p>
            <p>Some movies that I really appreciate include but aren't limited to, Crazy Rich Asians, Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar,
            Trolls: Band Together, Coraline, Little Women, and Pride and Prejudice.</p>
